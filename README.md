## 📖 Project Overview  
This mini project visualizes **Register Allocation** using the **Graph Coloring algorithm**, an essential concept in compiler design.  
It supports **SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production)** by encouraging **efficient utilization of computational resources**, minimizing energy usage, and promoting sustainable computing.

The project demonstrates how compilers assign variables to a limited number of registers efficiently using graph coloring — reducing the need for additional hardware registers and thus conserving power.

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Implement and visualize **Graph Coloring** for register allocation.  
- Demonstrate **efficient resource utilization** in compiler optimization.  
- Link compiler efficiency with **sustainable computing** principles.  
- Spread awareness about **SDG 12** in the field of computer science.

📊 How It Works
Each variable → represented as a node in a graph.

Edges → show conflicts (variables that cannot share the same register).

Graph Coloring Algorithm → assigns different colors (registers) so that no two connected nodes have the same one.

The algorithm aims to minimize the number of colors (registers) used.

💡 Example
Variable	Register
A	R1
B	R2
C	R1
D	R3

This reduces redundant memory usage and increases computation efficiency.

🌍 SDG 12 Connection
This project reflects United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 12 — Responsible Consumption and Production by:

⚙️ Optimizing Hardware Resource Usage — minimizing registers used.

💻 Reducing Computational Energy Waste — efficient allocation means less CPU work.

🌱 Encouraging Sustainable Programming — showing how compiler design choices impact energy efficiency.
